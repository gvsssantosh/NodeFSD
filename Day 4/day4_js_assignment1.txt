1. What is Regular expression in JavaScript?

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.

The search pattern can be used for text search and text replace operations.

syntax:    /pattern/modifiers;
ex-          /w3schools/i;

/w3schools/i  is a regular expression.

w3schools  is a pattern (to be used in a search).

i  is a modifier (modifies the search to be case-insensitive).
