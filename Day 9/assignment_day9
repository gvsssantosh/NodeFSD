What are the environment variables? Why do we use in Node JS?

Environment variables are a fundamental part of developing with Node.js, allowing your app to behave differently based on the environment(any computer or cloud) you want them to run in. Wherever your app needs configuration, you use environment variables.

why:
Because they externalize all environment specific aspects of your app and keep your app encapsulated. Now you can run your app anywhere by modifying the environment variables without changing your code and without rebuilding it.


when:
Any place in your code that will change based on the environment.
eg:
1. Which HTTP port to listen on
2. What path and folder your files are located in, that you want to serve


How to create and access environment variables?


passing the environment variables
1.using the command line
2.using a .env file
Create the .env file in the root of your app and add your variables and values to it.
eg:
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=8626
# Set your database/API connection information here
API_KEY=**************************
API_URL=**************************


accessing:
process.env.YOUR_ENV_VAR_GOES_HERE

What is ORM? Find some examples of ORM libraries and tools?
ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It's a programming technique that allows developers to map objects from an object-oriented programming language (like Python, Java, or JavaScript) to entities in a relational database (like tables, rows, and columns), and vice versa.
